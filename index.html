    <h1>Hash Tables (Hash Maps)</h1>
    <p>
      A <b>hash table (or hash map)</b> is a data structure that allow you to
      store and retrieve values based on a key. It uses a hash function to
      compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired
      value can be found. The hash function takes an input (often a key) and
      products a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a number.
      This number is used as an index in the array to store or retrieve the
      correspoding value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary advantages of hash tables are fast retrieval and insertion of
      data. They are widely used in various applications, including implementing
      associative arrays, caches, and database indexing.
